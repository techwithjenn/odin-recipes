        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package Polish sausage, or to taste, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
        <li>¾ fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ cup pineapple juice, or more to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar, or to taste</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, and green bell pepper until vegetables start to become tender, about 8 minutes; add pineapple and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pineapple is hot, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl using a whisk. Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and minced garlic with the pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves into the liquid; pour over the sausage mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
